                    Students will be working in teams of five to six from November 2020 to March 2021 to research and complete tasks related to one of the above topics. We have broken up our topics into 2 streams:
                    Research & Development
                    Research & Publication
                    The former involves building a project following your research that can be technical or non technical, and includes topics 1 & 2. The latter involves writing a report that will be published on NOVA's website and includes topics 3 & 4. Each team will have 5 - 6 members for a total of 20 - 24 students accepted. As this is our pilot year of the program, we want to work with a tight-knit group of students to properly develop our program curriculum.
